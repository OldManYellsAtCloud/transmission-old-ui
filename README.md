This is the web interface for Transmission bittorrent client, from release version 3.0.

It works in a drop-in way with the newest version of Transmission. This repository just 
stores these files for me - when Transmission is updated, its web interface is updated 
also. While I can live with the current interface, unfortunately (at least for me) the project 
decided to use modern development techniques, making the web interface non-functional in older 
browsers (e.g. I use my old iPad 4 to check on my torrents, but it is not compatible with 
the ES6 features used in the latest version.)

Upon Transmission update, I can just use these files to overwrite the interface.
